    "introduction": "The Patient Request for Corrections Implementation Guide provides a method for communicating a patient's request for corrections to their patient data, as well as a way for health care organizations to respond to those requests. This IG allows for several scenarios from a simple correction (such as changing the patientâ€™s smoking status) to more complex scenarios that may be accepted or rejected by the data holder. In addition, the IG handles flows from simple acknowledgement of submission to completion of review and acceptance/rejection.",
